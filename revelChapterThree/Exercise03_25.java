     * Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
     * And line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4)
     * Intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the linear equation
     * (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
     * (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
     * Can be solved using Cramer's rule.
     * If no solution, two lines are parallel
     * Program prompts user to enter four points and displays the intersection
