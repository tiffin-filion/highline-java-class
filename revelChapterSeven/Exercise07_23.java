/* Game: Locker puzzle
 * A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are closed on
 * the first day of school. As the students enter, the first student,
 * denoted S1, opens every locker. Then the second student, S2, beings
 * with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker.
 * Student S3 beings with the third locker and changes every third locker
 * (closes if it was open, and opens if it was closed). Student S4 begins
 * with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker. Student S5 starts with
 * L5 and changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100
 * changes L100.
 * 
 * After all the students have passed through the building and changed
 * the lockers which lockers are open? Write a program to find your
 * answer and display all open locker numbers separated by exactly one
 * space.
 * 
 * Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements, each of which indicates
 * whether a locker is open (true) or closed (false).
 * Initially, all lockers are closed.
